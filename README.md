## Creative cogs blog aApp.
 This is a Blog app that is setup to sign up users who can create and edit blog posts with the aim of creating a mental awareness site for the benefit of humanity...my philanthropic piece ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚
 
 
## Understanding the files.
*Blog_Project contains the main files for the whole app. while the file inside it that has the same name is the main file for the settings and all configs for the app.
*The Members app controls the users sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out mechanisms and collects user data to be connected to the database.
*The Blog app is where the views are controled from kindof like the home page for our app, it defines the views of the home page, articles view and many more cool features.

## Some features i'd like to include in the future.
_Commenting on posts_, 
_adding a profile image_, 
_specifying individual user actions_, " rn everyone has equal power as one can delete other's post but i'll specify that only the admin does that. " , 
_profile photos beside user's blog_, " rn only the name is included as an identifyer for user's post. "


# I hope you enjoy the app.
